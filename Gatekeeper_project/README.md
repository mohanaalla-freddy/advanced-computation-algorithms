# 🔐 Gatekeeper Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Gatekeeper Project** is a capstone-level implementation designed to demonstrate how **advanced algorithmic logic, rule-based decision systems, and structured data processing** can be combined into a single, coherent pipeline.

The project acts as a **“gatekeeper”** by evaluating inputs against a defined set of algorithmic conditions, applying computational logic, and producing deterministic, optimized outputs. It reflects real-world scenarios where systems must validate, filter, and make decisions based on multiple constraints.

This project is implemented in both **Jupyter Notebook** and **standalone Python script** formats to support experimentation, reproducibility, and production-style execution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a modular **decision-evaluation algorithm**
* Apply advanced computational logic using Python
* Ensure correctness, clarity, and performance
* Provide both interactive (notebook) and executable (script) implementations
* Maintain clean, reusable, and well-documented code

## 🧠 Algorithmic Approach

The Gatekeeper algorithm follows these high-level steps:

1. **Input Ingestion**

   * Reads structured input data (from in-memory structures or files)
   * Validates format and required fields

2. **Rule Evaluation**

   * Applies predefined logical conditions
   * Filters or flags inputs based on algorithmic criteria

3. **Decision Logic**

   * Sequential and conditional checks
   * Ensures deterministic and reproducible outcomes

4. **Output Generation**

   * Produces final validated results
   * Structured outputs for easy interpretation

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

From the root of the repository:

```bash
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the Python Script

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd projects/Gatekeeper_Project
python final_outputGATEkeeper.py
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run via Jupyter Notebook (Optional)

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open:

* `Final_output_GATEkeeper.ipynb`
* or `Final_output_for_project.ipynb`

Run all cells sequentially.

---

## 📁 Input Data (If Required)

If the implementation expects external inputs:

```
data/
└── sample_inputs/
    └── <input_files_here>
```

* Update file paths inside the notebook or script accordingly
* Ensure input formats match expected schema

---

## 📊 Outputs

* Validated and processed results
* Algorithmically filtered decisions
* Deterministic outputs suitable for evaluation or reuse

Outputs may be printed to console, stored in variables, or written to files depending on the execution path.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Observations

* The algorithm behaves consistently across multiple runs
* Modular design allows easy extension of rules
* Script version improves portability and reproducibility
* Notebook version improves explainability and transparency

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add configuration-based rule definitions (YAML/JSON)
* Support larger datasets with optimized data structures
* Integrate logging and error handling
* Convert into a reusable Python package
* Add automated unit tests
